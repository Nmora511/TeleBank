# TeleBank
Telebank is a web application designed to help you manage and track shared expenses with friends. In situations where someone pays for a shared cost, like a pizza or an Uber, itâ€™s easy to lose track of who owes whom and how much. With Telebank, you can log each transaction to keep a clear record of these debts. For example, if you pay for an Uber and each friend owes $5, you can create a transaction noting the $5 amount and add a description, like "Uber." This way, everyone stays accountable, and repayments are easier to track.

Telebank is accessible as a web app, making it compatible with both Android and iPhone, providing a seamless experience across devices.
